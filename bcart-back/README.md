## Starting the application
- Make sure you have node installed on your system.
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

- The server will start running on port: `5000`.
- The system already has a swagger module, so that you can view all the existing APIs available. You can view the swagger at http://locallohost:5000/swagger
